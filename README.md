# üèÅ ZloZiemie ‚Äì 2D Racing Game | Motorola Science Cup Finalist üèÜ

Welcome to **ZloZiemie**, a 2D top-down racing game inspired by Atari's *Badlands*. This game was built **entirely from scratch**, without using any game engines, as part of the **Motorola Science Cup** competition organized by Motorola Solutions.

Our goal was to explore game development fundamentals, with each team member focusing on core systems like rendering, physics, input, and AI. In particular, our AI system features **path-following opponents with obstacle avoidance** and collision curvature detection using **Linear Regression** over grid-based track data.
